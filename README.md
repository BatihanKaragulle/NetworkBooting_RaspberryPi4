SSH Connection and Configuration of Raspberry Pi
To configure our Raspberry Pi first we have to establish a connection and a network between our Server PC. For this project’s purpose a network connection through ethernet cable is sufficient. In more advanced projects cellular connection with 5G would be ideal. 


To share our network in Ubuntu first ethernet cable must be plugged in between Raspberry Pi and PC. In Settings/Network wired connection can be seen. In wired connection setting it is necessary to change IPv4 to ‘Shared to other computers.’
