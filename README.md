At the beginning we have to use an SD card with Raspbian Operating System installed in our Raspberry Pi just for setup.

## SSH Connection and Configuration of Raspberry Pi

To configure our Raspberry Pi first we have to establish a connection and a network between our Server PC. For this project’s purpose a network connection through ethernet cable is sufficient. 

To share our network in Ubuntu first ethernet cable must be plugged in between Raspberry Pi and PC. In Settings/Network wired connection can be seen. In wired connection setting it is necessary to change IPv4 to ‘Shared to other computers.’
